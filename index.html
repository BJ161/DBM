                At noon, a small fire erupted and though fire was localized but
the smoke reached to the top of temple, which created panic
among devotees. The fire was put off soon by pouring water by
the volunteers. But the panic did not give rise to stampede. The
possibility of a disaster was averted as the lower floors and
ramps were cleared sufficiently in advance and that provided
ample space for exit.

                The cyclone caused considerable devastation of property and crops, though
the loss of human life was minimal due to very good standards of early warning
and preparedness in the states. Keeping in mind the challenges
posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of alternate shelters
were identified to accommodate evacuees observing Covid protoco. Various State Government Departments, such as Engineering Departments, Public Works Department, Agriculture Department, Water Resources Department, etc. were deplyed for ensuring safety and wellbeing of the affected people.

damaged (Figure-24). Also, hotels and tourist lodges located along the NH-108 were completely buried
under the thick cover of landslide debris. The district administration along with scientific organizations worked
together to evacuate the houses in time. This avoided a potential major disaster. The administration
took prompt action and followed the recommendations of the experts.
The slope was modified and shotcreting was applied with wire mesh reinforcement on the entire slope.

                The rains resulted in landslides in hilly areas after torrents of water loosened soils from hill
                slopes. The floods highlighted a number of structural constraints that left Kerala unprepared for
                major disasters caused by natural hazard or climate change shocks. This included
                inadequate policies and institutional frameworks to manage and monitor critical natural
                resources such as water and land, absence of risk-informed spatial.Recovery from the devastating floods demanded significant amounts of resources
